- Hi, I’m Nguyen Ngoc Thien
- I’m interested in open-source softwares and Linux distributions.
- I’m currently learning at Nguyen Tri Phuong Secondary School in Hue, Vietnam and having a coding course in FPT FUNiX School.
- I'm not slim but not fat, with a quite balance BMI.
- Now, I'm working for Kode, which is an open organization which include the students or pupils that are interested with IT and always burn the midnight oil to code.
